**About me**
My interest in programming appeared 4 years ago when I entered the university. To be honest, at that time, I did not think that it could somehow interest me.

What is programming - I understood in the lessons on the introduction of programming. We studied the basics of programming using the C++ language as an example.

I think studying at RS School will give me a boost and take me to the next level.
